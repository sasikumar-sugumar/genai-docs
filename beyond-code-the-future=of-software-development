### Linear Logic vs. Human Creativity

Imagine you're playing with a big box of LEGO bricks. Generative AI, like a smart LEGO assistant, can help you build a castle following a specific set of instructions it learned from many other castle-building guides. It's really good at following these step-by-step instructions in a straight line, which we call being "linear." So, if you tell it you want a castle, it starts putting the bricks together in the exact order it learned, making a castle just like the ones in its guides.

But, let's say you want to build a castle with a secret tunnel that only your toy dragon knows about, and this idea isn't in any of the guides the AI learned from. This is where being "linear" makes it hard for the AI. It knows how to follow the steps it learned, but it doesn't know how to think outside of the box or get creative with your special tunnel idea.

Now, humans, like you and me, we can think in a "non-linear" way. This means we can come up with new ideas that aren't just straight lines. We can imagine the castle and then think, "What if there's a secret tunnel? Or a floating tower?" Our brains don't just follow the steps; they jump around to all kinds of fun, creative ideas, like making up a story about a dragon or a knight. We can build something entirely new and different every time, even if we've never seen a guide for it. That's the special human value of being "non-linear" – we can dream up and create things in all sorts of exciting and unexpected ways, just like coming up with the secret tunnel for your dragon in our LEGO castle.
### What is the role of the developer ?

### Non-linear Problem-solving

Developers, in contrast, engage in non-linear problem-solving. They must navigate ambiguous requirements, balance competing priorities, brainstorm innovative solutions, and apply judgment and ethics. Their work involves creativity, intuition, and the ability to foresee the implications of design choices in a way that AI, at least currently, cannot replicate. Developers synthesize knowledge from disparate sources, draw on past experiences in non-obvious ways, and engage in iterative, exploratory processes to solve problems.

## How developers will transition from writing detailed code to specifying outcomes ?

As generative AI technologies like GitHub Copilot become more sophisticated, the role of developers is poised for a significant transformation.
